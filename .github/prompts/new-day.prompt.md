create a copy of dayx, and then rename the folder and the file to be the next day in the sequence. 
For example, if there is already a day1, then then next day is day2.

Copy over the full contents of the folders, renaming all instances of "dayx" in the code to the new day number.

If there are no other day folders, then start with day1.
