# The Song of Ducks and Dragons — Born of Fire (Summary)

A mysterious, oversized egg appears on a mountain village blacksmith's doorstep. Placed in the forge's embers, the egg resists the flames until, in the night, it cracks open to reveal a strange hatchling — part dragon, part duck, with feather-like scales and oversized wings.

The narrative invites you to imagine being the newly hatched creature: where did you come from, who will you become, and what destiny awaits? The story sets a whimsical, mythic tone for the event, promising puzzles and challenges inspired by this hybrid creature and the warmth of the forge.
